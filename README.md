# Public Finance - Second Part, UCSC, Milan 
# Repository of notebooks 

by [Duccio Gamannossi degl'Innocenti](http://www.dgdi.me)


This repository stores the [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) notebooks for the second part of the course Public Finance at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Milan. 

Notebooks can be **viewed statically** here on GitHub but **not all the content will be displayed**. 
To correctly display the notebooks you need to **evaluate** them. For the **students of the course** it is advised to use either **SageMath** or **CoCalc**:

 * **SageMath** - [download](http://www.sagemath.org/download.html) and install SageMath 9.2 (SageMath 9.3, the latest version, does not display correctly some formulas) on your computer. Run SageMath Notebook and open the notebook of interest. See below for a step-by-step videoguide.
 * **CoCalc** - This option does not require any setup on your computer and so it is recommended if you are incurring problems during the installation of Sagemath. You can use CoCalc anonimously or as a registered user. When using CoCalc as an anonymous user, your session is temporary and all your data is wiped after some time of inactivity. Otherwise, you can sign up for a free account (you just need an e-mail) that allows you to store your data (more than enough for the purpose of this course). 
 
Here you can find video guides to open notebooks with [SageMath](http://www.dgdi.me/data/video/open_notebooks_sagemath.mp4) and [CoCalc](http://www.dgdi.me/data/video/open_notebooks_cocalc.mp4). 

See the notebook introduction - [here in its static version](https://github.com/dgdi/public_finance_UCSC/blob/main/notebooks/notebook_00_introduction.ipynb) -  for more information of the role of the notebooks in this course.
