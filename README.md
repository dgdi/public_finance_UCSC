# Public Finance - Second Part, UCSC, Milan 
# Repository of notebooks 

by [Duccio Gamannossi degl'Innocenti](http://www.dgdi.me)


This repository stores the [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) notebooks for the second part of the course Public Finance at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Milan. 

Notebooks can be **viewed statically** here on GitHub but **not all the content will be displayed**. 
To correctly display the notebooks you need to **evaluate** them. For the **students of the course** it is advised to use either **SageMath** or **CoCalc**:

 * **SageMath**: [download](http://www.sagemath.org/download.html) and install SageMath 9.2 (SageMath 9.3, the latest version, does not display correctly some formulas) on your computer. Run SageMath Notebook and open the notebook of interest.
 * **CoCalc**: allows you to evaluate the notebooks on the fly on [CoCalc.com](https://cocalc.com/) by clicking on "Run CoCalc Now" and uploading the notebook of interest. You will be asked to chose the kernel to open the notebook, scroll the page down and select SageMath 9.2. When using CoCalc on the fly a temporary session is created and you will lose all your data upon some time of inactivity. However, you can store your notebooks by signing up for a free account (you just need an e-mail). 
 
Here you can find video guides to open notebooks with [SageMath](http://www.dgdi.me/data/video/open_notebooks_sagemath.mp4) and [CoCalc](http://www.dgdi.me/data/video/open_notebooks_cocalc.mp4). 

See the notebook introduction - [here in its static version](https://github.com/dgdi/public_finance_UCSC/blob/main/notebooks/notebook_00_introduction.ipynb) -  for more information of the role of the notebooks in this course.
