# Repository for the course: Public Finance - Second Part, UCSC, Milan

by [Duccio Gamannossi degl'Innocenti](http://www.dgdi.me)


This repository stores the [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) notebooks for the second part of the course Public Finance at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Milan. 

Notebooks can be **viewed statically** here on GitHub but **not all the content will be displayed**. 
To correctly display the notebooks you need to **evaluate** them. For the **students of the course** it is advised to use either **SageMath** or **CoCalc**:

 * **SageMath**: [download](http://www.sagemath.org/download.html) and install SageMath 9 on your computer. Run SageMath Notebook and open the notebook of interest.
 * **CoCalc**: allows you to evaluate the notebooks on the fly on [CoCalc.com](https://cocalc.com/) by clicking on "Run CoCalc Now" and uploading the notebook of interest. When using CoCalc on the fly a temporary session is created and you will lose all your data upon some time of inactivity. However, you can store your notebooks by signing up for a free account (you just need an e-mail).
 
Here you can find video guides to open notebooks with [SageMath](http://www.dgdi.me/data/video/open_notebooks_sagemath.mp4) and [CoCalc](http://www.dgdi.me/data/video/open_notebooks_cocalc.mp4). 

 
* [![badge](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dgdi/public_finance_UCSC/main?filepath=notebooks%2Fnotebook_00_introduction.ipynb) A **hassle-free** but **slow** and **limited** alternative to open the notebooks is to click on the binder badge and then opening the notebook of interest. A temporary cloud instance is initialized with the software that allows to interact with the content of the repository. Given the size of the software that is needed, the loading page will state that "Your session is taking longer than usual to start!", this has to be expected and is perfectly normal. Please be patient while everything is set up, it usually takes 10-30 min. The temporary instance gets shut-down when inactive for more than 10 minutes. This solution allows to run the notebooks with just one click, so it is possibly **the best alternative for those who want to have a quick look at the material. However, given the loading time and the inactivity tresholds, the first two solutions (SageMath and CoCalc) are advised for the students of the course**. This service is provided by [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) (for more information see the [FAQs](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html)) based on work of [OpenDreamKit](https://opendreamkit.org/), a horizon 2020 research project
