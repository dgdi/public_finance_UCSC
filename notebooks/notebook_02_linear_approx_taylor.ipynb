    "Notebook for the Public Finance course at UCSC, by Duccio Gamannossi degl' Innocenti. You can find more information on the course on my [UCSC page](http://www.dgdi.me/#teaching) and on my [personal page](http://www.dgdi.me/#teaching).\n",

    "### Problem - Approximating linear demand and supply curves\n",
    "\n",
    "We might be interested in approximating the value of supply at a point nearby the equilibrium, because, for example, a tax has been introduced and prices changed from $p$ to $p+dp$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It will be now presented a general idea to deal with this problem and then we will apply the solution to supply approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### General setting for linear approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you know the value of a function $f$ at a given point $x_0$, i.e., $f(x_0)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "You want to know the value of the function $f(x_1)$ at another point $x_1$ nearby $x_0$ but do not know how the function behaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple possibility is to assume that the $f$ behaves as a line (increases of the same amount for every change in x). \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is something along the lines of:\n",
    "\n",
    "The function in $x_0$ is equal to $f(x_0)$, if the function were to move as if it was a line, then using the tangent $f'(x_0)$ seems to be a good choice given that it represents how $f(x)$ changes for a change in $x$ when at $x_0$. \n",
    "So, for every movement away from $x_0$, $(x_1-x_0)$ the $f(x)$ will change by $f'(x_0)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, the **linear** approximation of a function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x_1) \\approx f(x_0)+f'(x_0) (x_1-x_0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That can be read as: the value of a function at a point $f(x_1)$ can be approximated by the value at another point $f(x_0)$, plus the change that would have happened to $f(x)$ if it had continued moving as a line from $x_0$ to $x_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example related to the introductory notebook. We consider the function $f(x)=x^5$ and we consider the points $x_0=1$ and $x_1=1.2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We assume to know only\n",
    "   1. $f(x_0)=1$ \n",
    "   2. $f'(x_0)=5x_0^4=5$ \n",
    "\n",
    "then, the approximation $\\hat{f}(x_1)$ is equal to \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{f}(x_1) = f(x_0)+f'(x_0) (x_1-x_0)$$\n",
    "$$\\hat{f}(x_1) = 1 + 5 (1.2-1) = 2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "while the true value of $f(x_1)=1.2^5\\approx 2.49$\n",
    "\n",
    "We are making an error in our approximation, that is due to the fact that the function $x^5$ accelerates its increase while we are assuming that it continues to increase always at a constant rate. This can be easily seen using the plot of the introduction:"
